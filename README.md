## Test your ability to create

This app should be your _first step_ in **Phoenix Journey**. Simply because it's easy. Happy set this out, but we start with one of the fastests programming languages in on the planet _Earth_ - [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html) - click on the link to read the book about it and maybe some day you will create to.

## Instantiate

To run an app, not to create it, is easy - remember "__The Matrix__"? You're the battery, so keep the engine running ðŸ’¸
